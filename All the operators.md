<h1>Operators in Python</h1>

<pre>
Let's see all the available operators in Python.

First of all, we'll diccuss the types of operators:

1 - Comparision Operators:
    i) ==	Equal	                                           x == y	
    ii) !=	Not equal                                    	 x != y	
    iii) >	Greater than	                                 x > y	
    iv) <	Less than	                                       x < y	
    v) >=	Greater than or equal to	                       x >= y	
    vi) <=	Less than or equal to                          x <= y
    

2 - Assignment Operators:
    i) =	                                                 x = 5 is same as x = 5	
    ii) +=	                                               x += 3	is same as x = x + 3	
    iii) -=	                                               x -= 3 is same as x = x - 3	
    iv) *=	                                               x *= 3 is same as x = x * 3	
    v) /=	                                                 x /= 3 is same as x = x / 3	
    vi) %=	                                               x %= 3 is same as x = x % 3	
    vii) //=	                                             x //= 3 is same as	x = x // 3	
    viii) **=	                                             x **= 3 is same as	x = x ** 3	
    ix) &=	                                               x &= 3 is same as	x = x & 3	
    x) |=	                                                 x |= 3 is same as	x = x | 3	
    xi) ^=	                                               x ^= 3 is same as	x = x ^ 3	
    xii) >>=	                                             x >>= 3 is same as	x = x >> 3	
    xiii) <<=	                                             x <<= 3 is same as	x = x << 3
    
    
3 - Arithmetic Operators:
    i) +	                       Addition	                             x + y	
    ii) -	                       Subtraction	                         x - y	
    iii) *	                     Multiplication	                       x * y	
    iv) /	                       Division	                             x / y	
    v) %	                       Modulus	                             x % y	
    vi) **	                     Exponentiation	                       x ** y	
    vii) //	                     Floor division	                       x // y
    
    
4 - Logical Operators:
    i) and 	                     Returns True if both statements are true	                                          x < 5 and  x < 10	
    ii) or	                     Returns True if one of the statements is true	                                    x < 5 or x < 4	
    iii) not	                   Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	                          not(x < 5 and x < 10)
    
    
5 - Membership Operators:
    i) in 	                       Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object	                x in y	
    ii) not in	                   Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the object	            x not in y
    
    
6 - Identity Operators:
    i) is 	                       Returns True if both variables are the same object	                               x is y	
    ii) is not	                   Returns True if both variables are not the same object	                           x is not y
    
    
7 - Bitwise Operators:
    i) & 	                         AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
    ii) |	                         OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
    iii) ^	                       XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
    iv) ~ 	                       NOT	Inverts all the bits
    v) <<	                         Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
    vi) >>	                       Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
